"Bethod has gone rogue! He is on the warpath! 
Requesting backup from any and all ships in the Eris orbital, intercept the _Ravager_ or rendezvous at Earth. 

I repeat: BETHOD.. ROGUE.. WARPATH. 

Breq, over and out."

The sky is covered by a pink layer of cotton candy by the time I get there. It's falling down like snowflakes from a sunny tranquil sky, all beautiful and peaceful like.  But peaceful like and peaceful are two different things, and there's nothing peaceful about Bethod's fleet of cinereal destroyers unleashing a nuclear winter on the world. 

You have no idea who I am, or why I grab you, but I grab you. I drop an anchor in my timeline so I can return. Then we jump to the century 40k.

A man runs out of a citadel, approaching a satellite. One of its arms is on fire. He douses it with cold water from a can and waits for it to simmer. 

Many pairs of eyes watch him from the windows. Men and women hold rifles over ledges, all trained on the spacecraft. There're no cars on the street, no mode of transportation whatsoever, just troughs of water and saddles on a wooden fence. The horses have fled. 

That's when you notice that the thing on fire is really a Magnetometer. You've seen several hundreds of these on the job.. but it's an anachronism. 

I can literally read your mind. You think this is an alien invasion of the wild west. 

Meanwhile, the man is acting like he knows what the wreckage is. He's motioning to others in the building. As he puts his hands in the air, palms out, a woman walks up behind him with a megaphone. 

"Greetings to you, whoever you are. We come in friendship to those who are friends."

Familiar words but you can't quite place them. That's when you notice the inscriptions on the vessel. One says "Voyager", the other "Nasa". You gasp, your heart inching up your throat as you realize the significance of this event. 

"If the Voyager is inhabited we implore you to emerge. We mean you no harm". 

No doubt it is a nonsensical scene. Tens of gunmen training their weapons, a woman with an airhorn, a man with his hands raised, and the Voyager. They're obviously winging it. But you'd probably not know what to do in this situation either. 

I wait for you to ask the obvious question.. 

"We are approaching the satellite."

The man with his arms raised walks slowly forward. 

"We are touching the satellite."

The man prods the Voyager with his gloved hand.

Nothing. 

You ask the obvious question. "Which year is it?"

I smile. "It reached Proxima Centauri. Do the math".

You cruch your face like you're about to initiate an act of masochism. Then you realize the answer is a rusting five digit number. This isn't the wild west. This is far, far into the future.

"What ...happened?"

"The Voyager just landed"

"No, what happened to Nasa? To _us_? There's no way we haven't already detected this. These people.. this town.. they almost look primordial."

"Ah that. There was an attack. Humanity put itself into a deep cryogenic sleep for tens of thousands of years. All digital, magnetic and tape storage was destroyed in the interim. All scientific thought was rebooted. Sociological conventions erased. In short, your species was reborn."

The man has stopped prodding at the space craft. He seems to have hit a release key because an open hatch is casting light upwards. 

"Ironic" you say, one end of your mouth curving upwards, "that the gift of civilization left us when we needed it the most".

I smirk at your shit-eater platitude. 

Blades arent really so hard to hit as some claim, especially if you have enough of the figurative refuse matter. I should know, I just nailed a spinning propellor in the middle of nowhere at a range of four lightyears.

The man turns around and throws up. 
Several pairs of eyes disappear from the windows as guns go off. 
A purple gas begins leaking out of the punctured holes in the hull. 
The light from the hatch takes the form of a hologram.

"Your bio weapon has all but eradicated my kind. I am among the last few left. Hear my", the playback loops, repeating this over and over.  

Your pupils dilate in recognition as I walk up to the lurching woman and lift her megaphone.

"Your bio weapon has all but eradicated my kind. I am among the last few left. Hear my message: Today we return the favor."

By this time the Luciferium has made its way into your mouth, nasal tract and lungs. You fall to your knees coughing blood as it enters the condensation phase. It's like someone's opened your hole and fired a shotgun cartridge full of ballistic gel into your left eye. 

Bethod wanted a slaughter. 
I wanted to watch you die. 
We each had our cheap thrills.
I leave you sputtering on the ground and go back millennia to fetch the next member of the _Tranquility_.

We've successfully diverted the course of the Voyager to Proxima B. We expect landing at 1834+1ouc98. The current gravitational fields of the Centauri system makes entry anywhere in that radius equally likely, including its only moon, which we believe to be a penal colony.

<p><em><strong>An excerpt from The Scientific Review Letters, a journal summarizing research across the Kui. Orginal article titled &quot;On the nature and perils of Time Paradoxes&quot;</strong>
[Author&#39;s annotations appear in brackets].</em></p>
<p>Current theories on time paradoxes are summarized thus: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>The present is a result of specific choices made in the past. If you go back in time and kill your grandfater, you will cease to exist. [Back to the future time travel]</p>
</li>
<li><p>The current present is a result of specific choices made in the current past. If you go back in time and kill your grandfather, there is a branching of the timeline. A new reality where you no longer exist is created. [Rick and Morty time travel]</p>
</li>
<li><p>The current present is a linear combination of the past. If an event exists that would change the past, the probability of that event occuring is zero. In other words, time is a fixed path where everything happens for a reason. If time travel is permitted, it implies that time travel is part of the linearity. [Harry Potter time travel]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We interviewed Brequerine Abaddon, an aspiring scholar in astro-physics from Proxima B, and she gave us a fourth theory. </p>
<p>&quot;Miss Brequerine, we have 2 questions: is time travel possible? and how?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just Breq, please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Breq&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The answer to your first question is yes. We travel forwards all the time. Assuming you meant can we <em>jump</em> the timeline, that answer is Yes too. We can jump, as long as we return. We can loop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Time Loop.. interesting.. can you elaborate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s like the universe is govered by equations that preserve a certain equilibrium. One of the recurring variables in these equations is space, and another is time. The space/time continuity. </p>
<p>Typically, time is a progressing constant in these equations, meaning it moves forwards in predictable increments. The equations are governed by the space variable. However, we <em>can</em> manipulate time, as long as the output of the equation remains the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is just like the third theory then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Similar. The third theory is called Novikov Self-Consistency. The main difference is this: if you commit any.. atrocities.. that might change the output of an equation, the space variable changes drastically and re-balances. To put it simply, you could end up as many light-years away as the time you travelled to decrease the probability that your actions have a causal effect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So if I kill my grandfather&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the probability of you doing so is high..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Err.. yes, if the probability of me killing my grandfather is high.. I could travel back a day and find myself elsewhere?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct. Like Dysnomia without a fusion engine Elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, If I plan to save the world I&#39;ll remember to pack my vacation clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve heard soccer is more fun at half G. Pack accordingly.&quot;</p>
